# Polygon zkSNARK

Hello there, welcome to my project! For this project, I have designed a zkSNARK circuit that implements a specific logical operation and deployed a verifier on-chain to verify proofs generated from this circuit.

## Description 

This project is an implementation of a zkSNARK circuit using the Circom programming language. The circuit is designed to handle specific logical operations.

## Installation 

* Clone or download the code from the GitHub repository.
* Use the `hardhat-circom` template to write, compile the circuit, and generate proofs.
* Deploy the verifier to the Sepolia or Mumbai Testnet using public RPC and faucet.
* Call the `verifyProof()` method to verify the proof.


## Help
Ensure you are using the correct Solidity compiler version to avoid compatibility issues.
